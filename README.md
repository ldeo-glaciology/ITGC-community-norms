## Introduction

This is a repository for hosting and collaboratively developing International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration's community norms and values document. The text of the document is located in [index.md](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/ITGC-community-norms/blob/main/index.md) and displayed publicly at [https://ldeo-glaciology.github.io/ITGC-community-norms/](https://ldeo-glaciology.github.io/ITGC-community-norms/). 

## The document

In fall 2019, researchers of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) created a guiding document of values and norms for our community's behavior. This document outlines our desires for respect, creating an inclusive environment, acknowledging the value of diversity in science, ethical standards on scientific conduct, and an environment without harassment, bullying, or alienation. It also describes our values when writing and publishing papers in peer-reviewed journals, our values during fieldwork, and best inclusive practices when promoting ITGC work on social media. We present these guidelines here to acknowledge that our research community can improve its commitment and actions toward diversity, inclusion, and equity, and to note these guidelines as our starting point with more work to come throughout the project. 

## Contributing 
Hosting the document here on github is intended to facilitate ongoing development of our community's norms and values in a completely open and inclusive way. It is intended to be an ongoing collaborative effort across the ITGC and beyond. This approach takes its inspiration from the open code development community.

To contribute to the discussion of ITGC norms and values the best first step is probably to open a new 'issue' in the repository. You can do that by clicking on the Issues tab above and clicking the green 'New Issue' button in the top right. Feel free to comment on any aspect of the document and/or ITGC norms and values that you are interested in discussing. Once a new discussion is started the ITGC Science and Communications Office (SCO) and Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (IDEA) council, will be notified. Members of those groups, or anyone interested in contributing, can join the discussion. Then we can collectively decide if and what changes to the document are required. 

If you want to be kept up to date with any new issues that are posted you can 'Watch' this repository by clicking on the Watch button in the top right. 

Alternatively, please feel free to make edits directly to [index.md](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/ITGC-community-norms/blob/main/index.md) (where the text of the document is stored) and create a pull request. This will then be discussed openly and potentially merged. There are many guides online on how to make your first pull request, e.g., [here](https://medium.com/@akashnambitkr2000/a-beginners-guide-on-making-first-pull-request-76792c0cceb6).

If you have any questions, no matter how small, creating an issue is the first step, or alternatively contact the ITGC Science and Coordination Office at sco@thwaitesglacier.org.
